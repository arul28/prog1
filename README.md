**Ray Casting Function**:
   - Implemented a ray casting function that shoots rays from an eye position through each pixel of the canvas.
   - Defined the eye position at (0.5, 0.5, -0.5) and the window at z=0.

**Intersection Function**:
   - Created a function to check if a ray intersects with a triangle using the Möller–Trumbore intersection algorithm.
   - Implemented vector operations helper functions to support the intersection calculations.

**Color Rendering**:
   - Set up the rendering to use the diffuse color of the intersected triangle.
   - Implemented a black background for areas where no triangles are intersected.
